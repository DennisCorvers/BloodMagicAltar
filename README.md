# BloodMagicAltar
A crude calculator to calculate the optimal blood rune configuration for a blood magic altar. Default values are based on Gregtech: New Horizons.
The calculation brute forces a result for the large part, so it might take a minute to calculate a Tier 6 altar.

Run the program, enter the variables and get a result.


*The calculator is currently setup to only work with an EEC in Ritual Mode as a single altar setup. In other words, siphoning blood from another altar or orb isn't included.*
